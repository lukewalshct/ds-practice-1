Problem 1:
1. Can the parameters be assumed to be valid?
2. Are arrays with length 0 valid?
3. Can I assumethe first input array have size M?
4. Can I make assumptions about the distribution of the elements in the input arrays?
For example in array b, can I assume elements are in the first or the second half of the array?
5. Can I get clarification on sorted? I.e. is it okay to assume the input arrays are sorted in
ascending order, and the desired result is to have a merged array in ascending order?
6. By return the correct output, do you mean print results? Or can I change the signature of the
method from void to int[]?
7. Assuming it's ok to make the method public?
