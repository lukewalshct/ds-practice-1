Problem 1:
1. Can the parameters be assumed to be valid?
2. Are arrays with length 0 valid?
3. Can I assumethe first input array have size M?
4. Can I make assumptions about the distribution of the elements in the input arrays?
For example in array b, can I assume elements are in the first or the second half of the array?
